# Folder structure and exercises

In the `src` folder you'll find an example folder and exercise 1 and 2. Don't forget to reference the example when completing the exercises ðŸ˜‰

## Exercise 1

Refactor the `src/excercise1/RandomImage.jsx` using the useState and useEffect Hooks.

Tip: The fetchRandomImage function image for now should only be executed on the first render. So when you reload you see a new image.

## Exercise 2

### pt 1

1. Refactor the `FunctionalComponent.jsx` component to implement the useRandomImage hook and display the image using the Image component (it taks an src prop ðŸ˜‰)

2. Update the useRandomImage hook so that it also returns a function we can call to refetch the image and pass that to the onClick of a Button

### pt 2

Refactor the `ClassComponentRenderProps.jsx` component to implement the useRandomImage hook making use of your render props component export that work in a class.

2. Create and export a new function in `useRandomImage` that implements the HOC pattern.

Refactor the `ClassComponentHOC.js` component to implement the useRandomImage hook making use of your HOC component export that work in a class.
